# GNL_Tester

## Advice
Try not to use the tester if you are submitting the project for the first time. This tester is not DeepThought clone, don't trust it too much. Try make your own tests, try different file combinations and extreme cases. And good luck for your GNL.

### RTFM
Clone the repository wherever you want and change the `GNL_DIR` to the relative path of your `get_next_line` directory.

And in the repository, run:
* `sh start`: run all the tests
* `sh start m`: run all the mandatory tests
* `sh start b`: run all the bonus tests
* Run `./generate_500_files.sh` will generate 500 random files for you and make random tests. (This can be super slow, so I generated them already)
