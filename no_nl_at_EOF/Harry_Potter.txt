Harry Potter was born in Surrey, England, United Kingdom.
His parents, Lily and James Potter, were killed by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort, while Voldemort was trying to kill Harry.
Yet Harry escaped with no harm except a scar in the shape of lightning bolt, and Voldemort ends up mostly dead.
Harry is raised by his non-magical Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and cousin (Dudley), and is mistreated by them.
He believes the false words of the Dursleys that Harry's parents were killed by a car crash. As a child, he did not know that he was a wizard.
He eventually discovers that there are many magical people, living secretly and hiding from non-wizards (known as "Muggles").
When Harry turned eleven on July 31, he received a letter inviting him to go to a school called Hogwarts for young witches and wizards.
Each book tells the story of one year of his life at the school and tells how he struggles.
On Hogwarts Express, the train they use to get to Hogwarts, he meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, who become his best friends.
Voldemort tries several times to return to life and kill Harry.
In the fourth book, Voldemort comes to life with help from his follower, Peter Pettigrew.
The series ends with an epic battle between Harry and Lord Voldemort and a final epilogue that shows Harry and his friends safe and happy with their partners and children.
